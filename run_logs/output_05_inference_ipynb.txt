To silence this warning, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.

05_inference.py:637: DeprecationWarning: `np.long` is a deprecated alias for `np.compat.long`. To silence this warning, use `np.compat.long` by itself. In the likely event your code does not need to work on Python 2 you can use the builtin `int` for which `np.compat.long` is itself an alias. Doing this will not modify any behaviour and is safe. When replacing `np.long`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.
